# GrainDelayLike-EffectUnit
A tiny and simple iOS app featuring an effect unit inspired by granular synthesis and Ableton Live's Grain Delay. 
Uses mic in or internal sawtooth oscillator.

Early work in iOS development.
Audio processing done with Pure Data, then compiled in C with the EnzienAudio Heavy Compiler.
C code implemented in the app thanks to TheAmazingSoundEngine.
